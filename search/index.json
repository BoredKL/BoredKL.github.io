[{"content":" 弃我去者，昨日之日不可留\n乱我心者，今日之日多烦忧\n总览浦东二模 不得不说，今年浦东搞的一系列可谓迷惑无比，令人瞠目结舌。 五一前给等地已经很老卵，机构出分更是老卵，出完实际分更是老卵。 更有甚者说全A刚刚能上职校，这也是有点扯淡了。 卷子出的有点像溜过头了，沉浸在自己的世界中。虽然可以归咎于鄙人水平受限，但还是不能阻止我对浦东的拷打，以及对我自己的拷打。\n抽象语文 “处江湖之远则忧其君” 点击译为：被贬到偏远地方做地方官就替君王担忧\n但是在注释和任何正规翻译资料上都是：“处在僻远的江湖之间…”\n额，这差距可大了！ 被贬好歹是做了个官被贬的，而正规意思就是指在偏远江湖之间，一个有官一个不是官，完全不一样好嘛！！\n可惜“在野文天祥”先生大约的确是“处江湖之远”但未被贬，“被贬谪”已永恒的烙印在我的心头了\n点击实在害人不浅，当然主责在于我相信点击，那么抽象的错误都没看出来（虽然我现在还没搞懂为啥那个选项是错的嘻嘻）\n记叙文部分喜提概括全错，大题好似没看懂在搞啥，但我觉得我答的还是挺对的。\n综合运用“弘”居然没写出来，建议抄十遍\n弘弘弘弘弘弘弘弘弘弘\n改错居然写了个“屈尊就卑”，实在是来不及了瞎写一点，我估计浦东没几个像我这样写的。\n作文吗，不想说啥了\nWHAT CAN I SAY\n但是最后坠机喜提118当场轧钢，打回小学水准\n但我也搞不懂了，就算我作文-12，咋么能算出118的，难道我炸的还不够多吗\u0026ndash;\u0026gt;*\u0026ndash;\u0026gt;\n搞不懂。\n睡觉了，别的明天再说\n杂谈，感想 大概算是日记类的。不得不说现在真的是原来越难玩了。根本干不过纯天赋选手，但或许考完后面对的是另一个维度的打击，比三维更立体。\n作为第二，虽然能吃到校分配，但是还是和天赋选手能差28分，乖乖呀。\n人家稳居建平(人家只要上建平，而且人家裸考就差不多这个水平)，不得不承认确实是高水平选手。我呢，呵呵。可怕的差距\n山外有山。纵使侥幸得到名额，进去也是被吊打。这个二模也是让我对自己有了新的认知，虽说不宜妄自菲薄，但的确是毫无自信了。\n拼死拼活，在囹圄中搏杀。跳出囹圄，在新的囹圄被践踏。\n身处如此这般窘迫地位如何求生？方法或许只有提高个人水平，厚积薄发了罢！\n但愿吧\n2025 05 09\n","date":"2025-05-09T00:00:00Z","image":"https://boredkl.github.io/post/diary1/05091.png","permalink":"https://boredkl.github.io/p/pd2ndsim/","title":"浅谈浦东二模，以及杂谈"},{"content":"同样的感谢ChatGTPT独家赞助播出 二模轧钢自救指南\n「骄傲绽放的重要之人」\n春日影PV怎么那么快端上来了 一、原因状语从句（表示原因） 初级表达 高级表达 示例 because since Since it was raining, we stayed at home. because as As he was tired, he went to bed early. because of + n. due to / owing to + n.
